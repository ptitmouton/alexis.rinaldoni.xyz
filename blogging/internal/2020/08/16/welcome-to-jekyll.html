    <p>This is my first try and a cold start in the field of blogging, but I’d like to have a little publishing space and I’m really keen on seeing if this works out for me and what my success will be regularly finding interesting things to post and motivating myself writing articles.</p>

<p>I will publish in English, as I do not have very much of an opportunity of writing English regularly at work, my workplace <a href="https://be-terna.com">be-terna</a> being mostly active in Europe’s german-speaking countries (though trying to work on this).</p>

<p>For this first try, I wanted to have something up simple and quick, so I opted for <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and the ready-made template <a href="https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll">plainwhite</a>.</p>

<p>I want to see how it goes, this is the first time I work with a <em>Static Site Generator</em>, I’ll adapt when I have some content (and maybe even some readers, though this is no goal at all)</p>

<p>The blog’s source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ptitmouton/alexis.rinaldoni.xyz">github</a>, obviously there is not much to see yet.</p>
